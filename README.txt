## M03-A04 Implemented Design Patterns
### Abelardo Sobarzo:
Prototype
- The Items in the model folder are classes that take in properties from JSON arrays that create objects that from a single protype
    - src > model
Home Link 
- There is a Home link for all of our pages from to go back to the index.html page
    - index.html <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>

### Sam Kenny
Decorator
- Using the Javascript objects, we pass them into a Vue file where they are transformed into User Interface objects to be displayed on the screen
Sort By
- The Restaurants use a function that sort the restaurants by the name property of the object

### Heather Leins
Factory Method
- The Menu Item class has two sub-classes Drinks and Food and each have a separate section in the Menu
Dashboard
- When you first open up the system, a dashboard greets you with the current restaurants to which you can click and see the menu (In Progress)

## M03-A05 One Implemented Use Case
We implemented the use case of browsing restaurants. When you open the application, it allows you to log in. Once logged in you are presented with a screen with the available restaurants. We have the MVC classes in the src file and in each corresponding file.
